# Cyber Security Base Course Project
## Broken website

This course project is a broken website with some basic functionality. It is a basic user app. Users are able to register and log in along with some other features.

## Project description
The project is a web application that has five different flaws from the [OWASP top ten list](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) as well as their fixes. I am using the 2021 list. The application has a backend. It is implemented using Python and Django. Fixes are commented in the code and pinpointed in the [essay](https://github.com/macabre-cs/csb-project-broken-website/blob/main/essay.md).

### Security flaws
For this project I chose to implement the following vulnerabilities into my project.
- Missing CSRF protection
- Broken access control
- Server-side request forgery
- Identification and authentication failure
- Security misconfiguration
